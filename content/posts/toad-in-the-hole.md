During the COVID19 pandemic, I indulged in looking up simple-to-make recipes on cooking websites. My father chose to start raising chickens to get eggs. After he started getting a dozen eggs a day, a lot of my website hopping focused on recipes for eggs. This baked toad-in-the-hole recipe was the result. Depending on the size or number of sheet pans, you can double or triple this recipe easily.
