For this cake, you will need one two layer chocolate cake, mint frosting, chocolate mint cookies (I prefer Girl Scouts Thin Mints, but Keebler Grasshoppers or any other chocolate mint cookies will do) and ganache. <!--WPRM Recipe 132-->

-------------------

#### Chocolate Cake

-   5/8 cups unsweetened cocoa powder
-   1.5 cups cake flour (not self rising)
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1 tsp baking soda
-   1/4 tsp baking powder
-   1 stick butter (unsalted at room temperature)
-   1.5 cups granulated sugar
-   2 eggs (at room temperature)
-   1/2 cups strong coffee (or rum)
-   1/2 cup milk (whole or low-fat)

#### Mint Frosting

-   2 sticks butter
-   5 cups powdered sugar
-   1/4 cups milk
-   2-4 tsp all natural mint extract

#### Chocolate Ganache

-   2 oz semi-sweet chocolate squares
-   1/4 cup heavy whipping cream

#### Chocolate Cake (adapted from David Lebovitz's Devil's food cake recipe found here: http://www.davidlebovitz.com/2007/08/devils-food-cak/

1.  Adjust the oven rack to the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2.  Butter two 9"x2" cake pans and line the bottoms with circles of parchment paper. This step is key. The cake is delicate, and it will stick to the bottom of an unlined pan, a lesson I learned the hard way.
3.  To make the cake layers, whisk together the cocoa powder, cake flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl.
4.  In the bowl of a standing electric mixer, or by hand, beat together the butter and sugar about 5 minutes until smooth and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time until fully incorporated. Stop the mixer after adding each egg and scrape down the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is mixing.
5.  Mix together the coffee (or rum) and milk. Stir half of the dry ingredients into the butter mixture, and then add the coffee and milk. Finally stir in the other half of the dry ingredients. If using an electric mixer, stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl again, being sure to scrape the bottom as well. Another lesson I learned the hard way -- streaks in my cake.
6.  Divide the batter into the two prepared cake pans and bake for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool completely before frosting.

#### Mint Frosting (adapting from the cupcake bakeshop blog: http://cupcakeblog.com/?p=44)

1.  Note: the mint extract is variable depending on taste. I've used as little as 2 teaspoons, but as I love a minty taste, I usually go with 4 teaspoons. It's important to start low and work your way up with the extract, adding a teaspoon at a time until you've achieved the desired taste.
2.  Beat butter until creamy, scrape bowl.
3.  Add 5 cups of sifted powdered sugar, milk and peppermint extract, beat on low until combined.
4.  Once combined, beat the frosting on medium (if using a stand mixer) or medium high, whipping air into the frosting. It should double in size.

#### Chocolate Ganache

1.  Chop or break chocolate into small pieces. Place in a small bowl.
2.  In the microwave or on the stovetop, heat the whipping cream until boiling.
3.  Pour the whipping cream over the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is completely dissolved. Allow ganache to cool

#### Putting it all together

1.  Remove the cake layers from the pans and frost as usual.
2.  Place the chocolate mint cookies in a Ziploc bag. Seal, and crush the cookies using a rolling pin.
3.  Using the frosting spatula, gently press the cookies into the side of the cake. They should stick easily.
