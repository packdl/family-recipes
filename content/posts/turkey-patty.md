We have all had a salmon patty before. This is a nice turkey inspired version of that. <!--WPRM Recipe 120-->

Turkey patty {.wprm-fallback-recipe-name}
------------

<div class="wprm-fallback-recipe-ingredients">

-   4 oz turkey (cooked)
-   1 oz green bell pepper
-   2 oz rice
-   1 eggs (large)
-   salt & pepper (and other seasonings)
-   1 oz spinach
-   1 oz olive oil

</div>

<div class="wprm-fallback-recipe-instructions">

1.  Dice the green bell pepper and brown in frying pan. Set aside.
2.  Shred the turkey.
3.  Shred the spinach.
4.  Crack egg into a bowl and add turkey, spinach, bell pepper and rice. The rice is used as a replacement for the bread or bread crumbs usually found in a salmon patty. Bread/bread crumbs can be substituted.
5.  The mixture should be sticky enough to be formed into a patty. If it is too wet to do so, add rice and other fillers to make it more firm.
6.  Add salt and pepper and any other seasonings to mixture.
7.  Form mixture into two to three patties and place on wax paper.
8.  Add olive oil to saute pan. Place patties in hot oil and saute each side for two minutes or until fully browned.
9.  The patties can be eaten by themselves or as part of a sandwich.
