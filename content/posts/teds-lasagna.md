My father-in-law makes a wonderful lasagna. I managed to get his recipe by watching him make it when he came to visit his newest granddaughter. I know she will enjoy the recipe for years to come.

Some comments from Ted upon seeing my notes on the recipe:

Looks great,Remember to not overcook the noodles. They should not break when picked up with tongs and should be slightly hard but pliable. Also to have a sharp knife or scissors to cut strips of noodles to the size of the pan used. Iâ€™ve found that 4 layers is about max in height. Keep the sauce somewhat sloppy and not too thick as the hard cooked noodles will absorb a lot of moisture. I like leaving a prepared dinner covered over night to allow the flavor into the noodles,your choice. I really needed more garlic in our last meal and a thinner sauce. leftovers always taste better than the original due to the fact of the absorption of flavor into the noodles. Some people add 2 eggs to the cheese filling for fluffiness,either way works. I do like to add anise seed to flavor the sauce. One pound of sausage may be too much, and frozen chopped spinach really adds body to hold it together along with the eggs. <!--WPRM Recipe 116-->
