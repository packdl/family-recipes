This curried quinoa recipe is a result of the [curried goat](http://primarch/recipe/curried-goat/) I attempted. After making the goat, I realized that I had way more curry sauce than I had goat. At this point, I started searching for ways to make use of the rest of that curry sauce. Curried quinoa is one of the results. <!--WPRM Recipe 104-->

If you make the curried goat, you can drain around 2 cups of the curry sauce and use that in the place of the water, curry seasoning, and coconut water in this recipe.
