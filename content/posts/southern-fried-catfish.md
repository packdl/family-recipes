2.  Pour mixture into a flat pan large enough to hold the fillets.
3.  Spread fish in one layer over bottom of pan, turning to coat each side, and set aside to marinate.
4.  In a 2 gallon resealable plastic bag, combine the cornmeal flour, and seafood seasoning. add fish to mixture, a few fillets at a time, and tumble gently to coat evenly.
5.  Heat oil in deep fryer to 365 degrees Fahrenheit.
